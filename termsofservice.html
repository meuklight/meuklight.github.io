                  <h5>8. Payment Terms</h5>

                  <p><b>8.1. In-App purchases: </b></p>

                  <p>Upendra Attarde may license to you certain virtual goods to be used within the Apps and which you may purchase with real cash or which you may earn or redeem via gameplay (“Virtual Items”). When you obtain such Virtual Items from Upendra Attarde or its authorized designee, you receive a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and revocable license to use such Virtual Items within the applicable App and solely for non-commercial use.</p>

                  <p>Upendra Attarde may manage, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice. Without limiting the foregoing, Upendra Attarde reserves the right at any time to impose additional terms or conditions on your use of Virtual Items. Such additional terms and conditions will be effective immediately and incorporated into this Agreement. Your continued use of the App will be deemed acceptance thereof. If we need to contact you about your Virtual Items or your account, you consent to receive the notices by email. You acknowledge and agree that any such notices that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements.</p>

                  <p>The transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited, except where expressly authorized in the Apps, if any.</p>

                  <p>Virtual Items have no monetary value and are not currency or property. Virtual Items do not have an equivalent value in real cash and do not act as a substitute for real world money. Virtual Items cannot be sold, traded, transferred, or exchanged for cash. Virtual Items may only be redeemed for certain gameplay entitlements that may be made available within the App from time to time. Neither Upendra Attarde nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange Virtual Items for anything of value. Upendra Attarde has no liability for hacking or loss of your Virtual Items.</p>

                  <p>Price and availability of Virtual Items are subject to change without notice.</p>

                  <p>Unless otherwise required by law, all purchases and redemptions of Virtual Items made through the App or Services are final and non-refundable, and you are not entitled to a refund for any unused Virtual Items. Once you redeem a Virtual Item for a gameplay entitlement within the App or Services, such gameplay entitlement is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable. You acknowledge and consent that the provision of Virtual Items for use in connection with the App or Services is a process that commences immediately upon purchase and you forfeit your right of withdrawal once the performance has started.</p>

                  <p>Unless otherwise required by law, you agree that Upendra Attarde is not required to provide a refund for Virtual Items for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Items, whether your loss of license under this Agreement was voluntary or involuntary.</p>

                  <p>If you request your personal data to be erased as specified in MeukApps's Privacy Policy, you will permanently and without a right to a refund lose all of your Virtual Items as Upendra Attarde can no longer associate such Virtual Items with you.</p>

                  <p>EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT UPENDRA ATTARDE IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND TO YOU FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR ANY UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN YOU DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT, YOUR ACCOUNT IS TERMINATED, OR WHEN YOU CEASE TO USE THE APP OR SERVICES.</p>


                  <h5>9. Links to Third Party Websites or Resources</h5>

                  <p>The Services and Apps may contain links to third-party websites or resources.

You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from, your use of any third-party websites or resources.</p>

                  <h5>10. Termination</h5>

                  <p>We may terminate your access to and use of the Services, at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice to you. Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation of Services or your account, all provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive will survive, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution provisions.</p>

                  <h5>11. Disclaimers</h5>

WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.</br> We make no warranty that the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. We make no warranty regarding the quality, accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness or reliability of any Content.</p>

                  <h5>12. Indemnity</h5>

                  <p>You will indemnify us and hold us harmless including our affiliated entities and their and its officers, directors, employee and agents, from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to or use of the Services or Content, (ii) your User Content, or (iii) your violation of these Terms.</p>


                  <h5>13. Limitation</h5>

                  <p>NEITHER WE NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES OR CONTENT WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT WILL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR CONTENT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO US FOR USE OF THE SERVICES OR CONTENT, OR TWENTY DOLLARS ($20), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US, AS APPLICABLE.</p>

                  <p>THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN US AND YOU.</p>

                  <h5>14. Governing Law</h5>

                  <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Maharashtra, India, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</br>

                  Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>

                  <h5>15. Dispute Resolution</h5>

                  <p>If you are having a problem with a Service, many issues can be resolved on one of our forums. You may find resolution by clicking on the “Support” link on that App. Before bringing a formal legal case, first contact our support team via the App to address your issue. Most disputes can be resolved that way.</p>

                  <h5>16. Contact Information</h5>

                  <p>If you have any questions about these Terms or the Services, please contact us at upendra.attarde@gmail.com</p>
